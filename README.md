This repository stores our code (but not our data) for the Affirmative Action project.

The usage is fairly straightforward. The files live in five folders: code, data, input, output, temp. "_main.do" runs the whole thing. The .do files with the prefix "prep_" prepare the raw data, and the other files run the analyses, as described in "_main.do"


Other relevant information for referees:
- Typical install time on a normal desktop computer is less than 30 minutes, but requires owning a Stata license
- System requirements for Mac and Windows are given here: https://www.stata.com/products/compatible-operating-systems/
- The expected run time is a few hours for the full code, much less for a smaller version of the data that we provide for the peer-review testing purposes.
